<h2>My favorite thing to do in Kansas City to go to the Worlds of fun or oceans of fun. I like it because it brings me and my family closer together.</h2>


<h3>I love to go to the Gym when I have a free day. Or watch a show or play a game.</h3>


<h4>If I could go anywhere, I would go to Rome or Greece. Once there I would go visit the colosseum</h4>


<h5>My goal learning HTML to be able to build a brand and make a website for a company that they are satisfied with.</h5>
